Compute transit durations and peak-to-peak TDV amplitudes of binary planet systems. See Sample.ipynb for a quick tutorial on how to use this code.

cand.csv contains a list of 113 high-SNR (>36) KOIs at periods greater than 60 days exhibiting TTVs, taken from [Holczer et al. 2016](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0067-0049/225/1/9/pdf). These systems would be promising first targets to examine for binary planet-like TTV/TDV behavior.
